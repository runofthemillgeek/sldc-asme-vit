							<p>ASME India has been striving in enhancing its student sections' activities. On the request of the upcoming and existing student sections, the active ASME members and volunteers had decided to have a zonal level activity which resulted into inaugural version of SLDC 2015. The name Student Led Design Conference (SLDC) has been considered, as the event primarily targets the technical activities of the students sections. The prime motto of the event was to improve the technical strengths of the ASME affiliate members among already existing student sections and starting up new sections. It also aimed at active participation of students which increased awareness regarding ASME and its activities round the year ultimately helped in elevating the quality participation in SPDC-2016.</p>
							<p>ASME VIT is one of the proud hosts of SLDC 2016. The event will be held in Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore from 21st to 23rd October, 2016.</p>

								<p>The ASME Student Design Challenge involves Robotics. It providesÂ a platform to present solutions to a range of design problems. Each team is required to design, construct and operate a prototype meeting the requirements of the annually determined problem statement.</p>
								<p>The Student Design Challenge showcases the extraordinary talents of engineering students while encouraging them to develop innovative ideas towards an improved quality of life for all. Manufacturing plays an essential role in innovation. The field of manufacturing accounts for the majority of private research and development spending and employs a significant percentage of engineers. In order for society to benefit from the latest advances in technology, skilled engineers and novel manufacturing techniques will be required.</p>
								<p>The ASME Student Design Challenge is an excellent opportunity for participants to exercise new engineering skills, have some fun, impress student colleagues and come to the attention of industry representatives and recruiters.</p>
								<p>Design a small UAV to carry a cargo through two gates, see below, drop a payload and return to the starting point. This is an initial proof of concept prototype. You must design and build, at a minimum, the propulsion and control system for the UAV yourself. You cannot purchase and modify an existing commercially available vehicle. The device must be able to maneuver around and through obstacles, change height, and pass through a hoop for sizing.</p>
								<p>A hoop approximately 0.71-m (28-in) in diameter will be used by the judges to limit the size of vehicle. It is radio controlled.</p>

								<h2>Oral Presentation</h2>
								<button class="cs-button cs-button-gray">Coming Soon</button>
							</div>
							<div class="panel-body">
								<p>Like all professionals, engineers must possess a well-developed ability to synthesize issues and communicate effectively to diverse audiences. Among the highlights ofÂ ASMEâs Student Led Design Conference (SLDC)Â program is the Oral Presentation Competition. This competition is designed to emphasize the value of an ability to deliver clear, concise and effective oral presentations, particularly pertaining to some sphere in which an engineer is or should be involved.</p>
								<p>Each student presentation lasts fifteen minutes and is followed by a five minute "Question and Answer" (Q&amp;A) period. Each presentation in the Oral Presentation Competition must be delivered in English. The subject matter of each presentation must address a technical, economic or environmental aspect of engineering or other basic engineering theme, provided it pertains to some sphere in which an engineer is or should be involved. A major portion of a contestant's total score is based on the judges' evaluation of his/her relative capability to communicate orally, including evidence of a talent to respond effectively in the Q&amp;A period.</p>
								<p>A competitor may utilize any available resource but must realize that the presentation is to be an individual effort. Assistance in the use of visual aids is advisable (PowerPoint, etc.). Film clips, if used, may not exceed one-minute total duration (i.e. a maximum of one minute of each student presentation may be used for video). Film clips may not be accompanied by any recorded sound. Good practice and courtesy suggests credit be given during the presentation for any outside help related to the reported project. A written paper or manuscript is not required.</p>
