							<p>ASME India has been striving in enhancing its student sections' activities. On the request of the upcoming and existing student sections, the active ASME members and volunteers had decided to have a zonal level activity which resulted into inaugural version of SLDC 2015. The name Student Led Design Conference (SLDC) has been considered, as the event primarily targets the technical activities of the students sections. The prime motto of the event was to improve the technical strengths of the ASME affiliate members among already existing student sections and starting up new sections. It also aimed at active participation of students which increased awareness regarding ASME and its activities round the year ultimately helped in elevating the quality participation in SPDC-2016.</p>
							<p>ASME VIT is one of the proud hosts of SLDC 2016. The event will be held in Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore from 21st to 23rd October, 2016.</p>

						<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) is a professional association that, in its own words, “promotes the art, science, and practice of multidisciplinary engineering and allied sciences around the globe” via “continuing education, training and professional development, codes and standards, research, conferences and publications, government relations, and other forms of outreach.”ASME is thus an engineering society, a standards organization, a research and development organization, a lobbying organization, a provider of training and education, and a nonprofit organization. Founded as an engineering society focused on mechanical engineering in North America, ASME is today multidisciplinary and global.</p>
						<p>ASME has over 140,000 members in 158 countries worldwide.</p>
